Railway deployment work log (without .env values)

1) Backend production hardening:
- Added proxy/SSL-aware Django settings for Railway:
  - `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST`
  - `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`
  - optional secure cookie and ssl redirect toggles from env names
- Added CORS/CSRF origin lists from env names:
  - `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
  - `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
- Added `postgres://` compatibility fallback to `postgresql://`.
- Added WhiteNoise static serving for Django admin/static in production.

2) Backend runtime scripts:
- Added `backend/start-web.sh`:
  - runs migrations
  - runs collectstatic
  - starts gunicorn on `PORT` (Railway-compatible)
- Added `backend/start-worker.sh`:
  - starts Celery worker

3) Backend container update:
- Updated `backend/Dockerfile`:
  - keeps Python runtime setup
  - marks startup scripts executable
  - defaults CMD to `start-web.sh`

4) CV analysis flow fix for Railway multi-service:
- Removed dependency on local shared filesystem between web and worker.
- `AnalyzeCreateView` now extracts text directly from uploaded file and sends text to Celery task.
- Celery task now consumes text payload for CV source, so worker no longer requires file path from web container.
- Updated parser with upload helper and bounded text size.

5) Frontend production readiness:
- Updated `frontend/package.json` start script to bind host and Railway `PORT`.
- Updated `frontend/Dockerfile` for production:
  - `npm ci`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run start`

6) Dependencies:
- Added `whitenoise` in backend requirements.

7) Documentation update:
- Added a full Railway deployment section to `README.md`:
  - service split (web/worker/frontend/postgres/redis)
  - monorepo root-dir mapping (`backend`/`frontend` with local `Dockerfile`)
  - required env variable names only (without values)
  - domain wiring and health-check flow

8) Regression-safety adjustment:
- Set secure cookie defaults based on `DEBUG`:
  - local debug defaults remain non-secure for easier local testing
  - production default remains secure

9) Frontend start compatibility:
- Kept `npm start` script platform-neutral.
- Moved Railway `PORT` binding logic to Docker `CMD` so local Windows npm usage is unaffected.
